# API-challenge

- Coding Quiz Challenge is an interactive webpage that sends the user through several stages of a quiz game. There is an introduction page that explains the rules, a timed quiz and then a high scores sections where the user can save their name and high score.

## API Project

- In this project i was given a mockup of a quiz and was asked to replicate it as close as possible.  Some of the features that I added to the quiz include...

    1. added a persistent "view high score" button and Timer that remained consistent and active throughout the entire quiz regardless of div toggle.

    2. used an array to populate the question and answer sections so that additional questions could be added with minimal change to the code.

    3. Used DOM manipulation to create several div containers that I then made toggle based on the users input.

    4. created a high score section that would save name and score as an array and then pull and display high scores from highest to lowest.  I used methods such as "sort", "map", and "splice" in order to accomplish this.

    5. created a repository on GitHub at URL
